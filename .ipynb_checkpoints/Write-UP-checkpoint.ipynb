    "This project is an implementation of a non linear Model predictive controller for driving a self driving car around track in simulator. The simulator feed the system with stream data that contain car position, velocity and orientation and also the way-points of the trajectory reference that the car should to follow. The control system is designed based on car Kinematic model that ignore that ignore tire forces, gravity, and mass.\n",

Higher `dt` will produce lowe resolution however by decreasing it by less than 1.5  the car make high oscilation either in low speed or high speed. `N` determined as minimum to consider the computation time. the time horizon `T` affect the car speed to keep the trajectory as possible in futur.\n",
